# cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is very important in curtailing cyber crime across Nigeria and the world at large. The idea behind this project is majorly a preventive approach to increase 
sharing of information among users to quickly expose new exploits used by cyber criminals. The second part is the technical part which uses web scanner to encourage constant 
check of domain and websites for possible pishing attack. They are about dozens of websites that sell victims personal information such as identity, credit and debit card and sometimes other
personal items. Our approach is to automate the scanning of the websites and pull information in continous feedback to the victim or the respective bank associated with the card.
The use of software to implement text to QR code payment will reduce card fraud.

Over  5 billion Naira is lost to card fraud  as reported yearly. The figure should be more and most users do not share information or report. We want to facilitate rewarding 
victims who share information about their experience in pecks. People and institutions  not sharing information is the greatest hindrance in reducing cyber crime and credit card
fraud.
